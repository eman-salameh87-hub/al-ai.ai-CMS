/**
 * What goes into a backup, decided table by table.
 *
 * An allow-list, not "dump everything". A backup is a file that leaves the
 * server and lands in someone's downloads folder, so the question for each
 * table is not "is it ours" but "should it be in that file". Getting it wrong
 * in the generous direction puts live session tokens in an email attachment.
 *
 * The list is explicit so a table added later is absent until somebody
 * decides — which is the safe default. tests/backup.test.ts fails when a
 * table exists in the schema and appears in neither list.
